# Heart Disease Classification using MLP

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a binary classification model using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with Keras to predict the presence of heart disease. The model aims to help in identifying individuals who are at risk of heart disease based on various health indicators.

## Dataset Description
- **Dataset**: The dataset used in this project is a heart disease health indicators dataset. It includes various features related to physical and clinical measurements.
- **Source**: [Include the link or mention if itâ€™s proprietary]
- **Features**:
  - `age`, `sex`, `cholesterol`, `blood_pressure`, and other clinical variables (specific names would be based on the dataset).
- **Target Variable**: 
  - `heart_disease` (binary: 1 indicates the presence of heart disease, 0 indicates absence).
